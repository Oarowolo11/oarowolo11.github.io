I am a PhD candidate in the [IEPG](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/electrical-sustainable-energy/intelligent-electrical-power-grids-iepg-group) group at Delft University of Technology. I am also a member of the 
[DAI Energy Lab](https://www.tudelft.nl/ai/delft-ai-energy-lab) under the supervision of [Dr. J. Cremer](https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/j.l.cremer/) 

My general research interest is applied machine learning for management and control of power grids. Currently, I am investigating geometric deep learning for electromagnetic transients simulation in power grids.
