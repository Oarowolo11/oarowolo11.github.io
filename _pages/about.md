I am a PhD candidate in the [IEPG] group at Technical University, Delft (https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/electrical-sustainable-energy/intelligent-electrical-power-grids-iepg-group). I am a member of the 
[DAI Energy Lab] (https://www.tudelft.nl/ai/delft-ai-energy-lab) under the supervision of Dr. J. Cremer (https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/j.l.cremer/) 

My general research area is applied machine learning for management and control of electricity grid. Currently, I am investigating geometric deep learning for electromagnetic transients simulation.
